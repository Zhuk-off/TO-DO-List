# To Do List (JavaScript)

ToDo List - a list of tasks, where in addition to the list, you can also create categories of tasks, and you can sort tasks by dragging and dropping (there is Drag&Drop). All data is stored in your browser.

Stack and what I did: I made a layout. Styles SCSS using variables. I tried to use BEM for naming classes and wrote JavaScript code (while studying it at the same time). I used modular architecture for the project. I installed and configured Webpack 5 to build the project (configured webpack.config.js, package.json, this is all set up manually here instead of coming out of the box like React or NextJs frameworks). Installed and configured Babel with Webpack + dev and production version builds. I used Git+GitHub for version control.

This project is still raw and needs to be completed. I have been learning about technology and working on it.
